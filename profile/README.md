# Welcome to the Senzing Garage

If you are beginning your journey with [Senzing],
please start with [Senzing Quick Start guides].

The **Senzing Garage** is where projects are "tinkered" on.
Although these GitHub repositories may help you understand various approaches to using Senzing,
they are not considered to be "production ready" and are not considered to be part of the Senzing product.
Heck, they may not even be appropriate for your application of Senzing!

For assistance with any **Senzing Garage** repository,
use the repository's [GitHub Discussions]
for general discussions or [GitHub Issues]
to report a bug or make a feature request.
